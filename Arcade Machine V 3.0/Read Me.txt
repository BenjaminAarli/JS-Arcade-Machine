Arcade Machine Version 3. 27.09.2017

HOW IT WORKS!: 
The HTA (html Application, Yes, That is a thing.) 
starts up. When hitting the "start game" buttons the HTA 
then runs a VBScript that opens an EXE file, made 
from a BAT file that opens the GBA games. 

Not very advanced stuff. This was my starting brick on coding.
However, it was also my highest achieavement so...whatever. 

I worked on this a while back and a lot of it was sloppy 
code-work and an excessive amount of bugs. I diden't 
really understand JavaScript and that really hit my 
today. I fixed a lot of it but when originally writing 
this I diden't actually think I would show it to anyone...
or work on it again. 

However! I fixed a lot of it and it works now with five
different games. (in which. It kinda alway did.) 
It worked, but was less good. Actually, you can still 
check it out! There's a folder called "Previous Arcade 
Machines" that show my demise! Enjoy! 

OH! By the way, It's probably gonna be flagged by your 
anti-virus software! and rightfully so. The code access'es
your harddrive (technically) and runs bats (exe) files to 
access the GBA files.  

Sincerely your, Benjamin Aarli.
