Arcade Machine Updates. 

As this project grew and more and more became error handling and problem solving I realized 
that I need a way to see my previous misstakes so I won't be repeating them as much as I have. 



--------------------------------------------------
Version 0.x2 /19th of march 2017.

*Found Bug
Bat (or, actually EXE files) need to be re-built.
The bat(EXE) files start where the HTA starts, so 
// 
cd .. (<-- THIS IS THE PROBLEM.)
cd Games\Games GBA
start "" "Game.gba" 
//

I removed the problem. 
----------------------------------------------
Version 0.x2 /23rd of april 2017. 

*Not technically a bug
Realized that the HTA looks like shit so decided to rework it into a 
more "retro" (Arcade Machine) look. 

I also created a new HTA file, becoming the (MASTER FILE) that 
starts the entirety of the application. It will be a 
"Press START to begin" screen. That's pretty much it. 
-----------------------------------------------
Version 0.x2 /25th of april 2017. 

*Not technically a bug
Changed the name for the file "Bug Reports.txt" into 
"Status Reports.txt". Sounds cooler. 

I can't remember all the changes cause I've done a lot and forgotten
to write it down but the basic gist of it is. (I wrote the previous update today because I forgot to do it at the time of the updateing)
*Created new folder called "Code Backups" in which stores backups. 
*I've played around with design and decided, as previously stated, an arcade-ick look.
*Created a new folder called "Pictures", that contains pictures of Kirby as of the moment. 

Anything else was either edits in the original code (In which I have back-ups off)
or seperate, unimportant matters. 
-----------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 /26th of september 2017. 

Fixed a lot of sloppy code. 
Moved some files into folders instead of having them out in the open. 
Changed some file names, within and out of scripts. So it still works, but looks better.  
Cried uncontrollably in the shower. This is a joke. or is it? Nobody ever reads these so I'm fine. 

So, currently I have four (4) different arcade machine scripts all doing (essentially) the same 
thing. So I decided to make an index.hta and page2.hta/page3.hta/page4.hta 
(or gba.hta/nes.hta/snes.hta individually).
